This is a MATLAB program which convolves radio-telescope data onto the grid, one of the most time-consuming processing steps to create a sky image. 

## W-projection explanation

The first step of the process of creating a sky image out of radio-telescope data is pair of antennas sampling the electromagnetic spectrum at a high rate. The integrated product of such a sample is called a visibility, and has an associated *(u,v,w)* coordinate, depending on the position of the antennas, the position of the observed source, the frequency of te observed signal and the time. The *(u,v,w)* coordinates for an antenna pair change over time due to rotation of the earth.

Since the visibilities are sampled in the Fourier domain, the next step is take these points and perform an inverse Fourier transform operation operation on all of them to create a sky image. However, with a lot of data this process consumes an exorbitant amount of time, and is not feasible for practical used. Therefore these visibilities are first placed on a UV-grid, so that a two-dimensional FFT can be used. Doing this converts the UV-grid to a sky image in a much more effective fashion. 

While a visibility can be simply rounded to the closest grid point, this is not fully correct: a visibility contributes to neighboring grid points as well. Therefore this contribution is obtained by convolving this visibility with a convolution matrix. Since a convolution represents a multiplication in the Fourier domain, the contribution can easily be obtained by multiplying the visibility with points in the convolution matrix and adding this result to the grid. In this application the convolution matrix is considered as a precomputed matrix of real weights, and is referred to as the support matrix.

This would be all that is necessary when the earth and the observed part of the sky are considered flat. However, since this is not correct, this dimension must be accounted for. This is done by using a third coordinate w and a technique called wide-field imaging. We implement this extra dimension by making different convolution matrices for different values of w,  typically using several tens of w-planes. When all the visibilities have been convolved to the grid, a final IFFT is performed to obtain the desired sky image.

This code basically does the gridding step: it puts every visibility or *(u,v,w)* point on a grid point and makes it contribute to neighboring grid points by using a convolution matrix dependent on w. It is also able to do the inverse process: converting a grid back to visibilities.

## Code explanation

A implementation of gridding radio-telescope data using the W-projection algorithm has been created in MATLAB. Although some code projects already exist which can do about the same thing, they are rather complicated and inaccessible. Two of such implementations where this program is based on are [1] and [2], both created in C++. 

### Initialization
At the top of the code the user is able to choose a *mode*. This *mode* variable can be set to either 1, 2 or 3, representing the simple, w-projection and interpolation mode respectively. The functioning of these modes is explained later.

After that, many variables can be customized depending on the user's requirements. The first value to be set is *oversampling*. Oversampling is the process of making the support kernel more dense in comparison to the grid it's in. This way, instead of (u,v) coordinates simply being rounded to the nearest integer, they get scaled according to their fraction depending on how many times we're oversampling. Oversampling with a factor 2 makes (u,v) coordinates round to halves, with a factor 3 to thirds etc. This way, the accuracy is improved but the computation time will be longer.

Next, some variables can be set to tweak the program as desired. These determine the size of the support kernel, the size of the total grid, the number of frequency channels, and the number of points taken from the dataset. Real (*u,v,w*) coordinates from a six-hour LOFAR observation with 44 antennas (946 baselines, 10s integration time and one subband of 16 frequency channels) were used as taken from [1]. These are further subdivided in timesteps and blocks, but can be tweaked as necessary. 

Frequencies are set, differing slightly for every channel. The frequencies in this case used are around 60 MHz, but of course any values can be used as long as they are in the radio frequency. After this, visibilities are set. In this example they are all set to one, but of course any (complex) value can be taken.

### Mode 1: Simple mode
#### Generating the kernel
The simple mode uses a rather standard kernel which is has two dimensions, and so matches with the grid. It is generated by the following formula:

support(i,j) = exp((i-ccenter)^2 + (j-ccenter)^2); (1)

Where ccenter is the center of the support kernel. With this formula, the center of the support kernel will be equal to one, and the the farther away one is from the center the lower the values are. For example, with a 9x9 support kernel, the values at the corners and so the farthest away from the center are 1,2664e-14. 

Formula (1) holds for the general case where we're not *oversampling*. In the case that we're oversampling, we add a scaling factor to it so that the values at the edges remain the same.

#### Gridding
Since no w-coordinates are used in the simple mode, just the first and second column of the data are taken. These *u* and *v* coordinates are scaled according to the defined frequency and cellsize. 

Next the program enters its main execution loop, going over all data points. The current scaled _u_ and _v_ points are set to the variables _uscaled_ and _vscaled_ respectively. The fractional part of the current _u_ and _v_ coordinate is determined by first rounding and then computing the difference.

The index we will update in the grid is equal to the integer value of a point plus half of the grid size (so that we look at the point from the middle of the grid). Now, we convolve the point with the support kernel by multiplying the visibility with some values of the support matrix. Without oversampling we do this with support values taken from around the center, but with oversampling this changes depending on the fraction. The results are added to the grid.

Finally, after this process is repeated for every grid point, the grid is flipped so that _v_ is not inverted and the result is plotted.

Generally, oversampling is slightly faster than interpolating. Testing some data we noticed that generally the oversampling mode was about 1,5-2x faster. This can be explained by the extra computations done in the most computationally intensive innter loop of the code.
